We start by parsing out the "OverallRating" and create descriptive statistics to understand the variable better:

+-------+------------------+
|summary|     OverallRating|
+-------+------------------+
|  count|             41860|
|   mean| 3.031438127090301|
| stddev|2.8886263423705905|
|    min|                 0|
|    max|                10|
+-------+------------------+

Next, I cleaned the variables and then regressed this OverallRating survey variable with the HCAHPS_Base_Score variable and got a very high R^2 of: 0.8131181281720886.
Finally, I performed a regression between the OverallRating survey variable with HCAHPS_Consistency_Score and got a reasonably high R^2 of: 0.5954872552183783.

The high correlations tell us that the survey respondents are good predictors of actual hospital performance.
